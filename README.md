Robot Kaja
==========

MPS sample robot language. Allows users to program scripts for a virtual robot to let him walk around a rectangular space, pick or drop items and avoid walls.
Consider watching [an introductory MPS screen-cast](http://tv.jetbrains.net/videocontent/your-first-date-with-jetbrains-mps) to see the language in action.
